_bartDown_ displays the estimated departure times for a [BART station](http://www.bart.gov/).  It aims to make functional information aesthetically pleasing so it can be displayed in the home.  Colors denote the Bart line and North and South-bound depatures are on the top and bottom row respectively.

See it in action (currently focused on Oakland 19th St): http://powerlanguage.co.uk/bartDown/
